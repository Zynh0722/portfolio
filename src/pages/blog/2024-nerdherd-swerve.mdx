- Figure out impact of wpilib 2025

## Preface

The current NerdHerd swerve codes core functionality is all put together
by hand, using WPILib utils whenever possible to offload work. As such it also
doesn't do anything fancy that you might get with using [CTRE's swerve
framework] or [YAGSL], such as heading correction or cosine compensation.
It also doesn't do some simple things, like a lock pose. This doesn't mean
those things are impossible, the code is simple enough
that any of those features could be added.

While lacking in functionality, our repository also isn't a bastion of code
quality. You'll find our code almost entirely uncommented, and structurally
questionable.
